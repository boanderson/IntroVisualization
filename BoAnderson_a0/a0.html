    <h2>Visualization that I liked:</h2>
    <img src="Field-of-Commemoration.png" width="1200px" height="auto"><br>
    <p>I liked the Field of Commemoration visualization as it encapsulates a vast amount of information in a warming, 
        respectful way. The complexity of the graph is simplified due to the innate ability for an observer to understand
        the beauty of a poppy diagram. The size, color, shape, bend, and length all contribute to each poppy's held 
        information. The number of wars represented in this diagram is also astonishing, allowing us to gain a greater 
        understanding of how severe even the least well-known wars can be. Everything about this visualization speaks 
        in-character, and I believe that after observing this diagram I can say that I have learned much more about 
        the crucial impact that wars have on communities.</p><br>
    <h2>Visualization that I disliked:</h2>
    <img src="life-expectancy-breed.webp" width="900px" height="auto"><br>
    <p>I disliked the Average Life Expectancy by Breed table as it didn't take advantage of the creativity that can be 
        accomplished with a dataset like this one. Although it "checks the boxes" and provides the information desired 
        for that webpage, it could be improved in order to allow more engagement with the audience. I think by spicing 
        it up a bit with the form of plot, it can allow the user to understand the data faster, more efficiently, and 
        in a strong, mood-setting way.</p><br>
    <h2>Alternate Visualization:</h2>
    <img src="New_Version_Life_Expectancy_Breeds.png" width="1300px" height="auto"><br>
    <p>My new design, New_Version_Life_Expectancy_Breeds.png, brings great change to the original dataset, but there 
        are still a few lingering problems that my design causes. First, I did not ascertain that the colors used are 
        color-friendly for anyone, regardless of color blindness. Second, the text along the horizontal axis that 
        represents the different breeds is not the easiest text to read, so could improve on the overall coloring/font/slant 
        of the text there. Third, the shadowing behind the horizontal and vertical axis labels could make the text "pop" 
        a little more, the text is still slightly faded into the background.</p><br>
