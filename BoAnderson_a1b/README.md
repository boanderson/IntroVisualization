1. Stack Overflow, 2019, "Get width or height svg rectangle javascript", 9/20/2021, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26410653/get-width-or-height-svg-rectangle-javascript

I used this thread to find the current width of the rect elements while iterating through them. That way I could create the staircase() function to keep track of each current rect's width and find the maximum one.

2. Stack Overflow, 2017, "How to call a function on 'load' event in D3?", 9/20/2021, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14923811/how-to-call-a-function-on-load-event-in-d3

I used this thread in order to figure out how to call to changeData() on page load in order to allow for the initial spawning of the graph elements to be consistent scaling with the premade functions in assignment 1b.


EXTRA:
I attempted at getting the bar graphs to change fill color when mouseover, but for some reason adding the event listeners iteratively seems to mess up the dynamic of all of the listeners. Therefore, I left some of the attempt commented out for your reference to see where I was able to almost get it.
