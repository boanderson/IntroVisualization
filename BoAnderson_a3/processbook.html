<h2>1. Design</h2><br>
<h3> - What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</h3>
<p>I want to be able to provide a minimal, yet energetic style of displaying
    all of the fairy tales available. I think that fairy tales are known for
    providing an up-beat, colorful experience, therefore I hope to replicate that
    in the way I display my information.
</p>
<h3>What story are you trying to tell with your design?</h3>
<p>I want to make a kid-friendly, fun visualization that can provide all of the
    information needed while also not overwhelming the user with all of the stories
    available to choose.
</p>
<h3>How can you highlight a different perspective?</h3>
<p>With the dataset only including the title of the story as well as an excerpt from 
    the story, it seems that  it would be fun to explore the ways in which I can use opacity,
    color, and size to display all of the information that I want.
</p>
<h3>What tasks do you want to support?</h3>
<p>I want to support similar tasks as Studio 7, where we had the mouseover options as well as 
    displaying information in a 3-dimensional layout. I think it would be more enticing and
    fun for the audience to interact with a 3-dimensional navigation area to decide on the story
    they want to choose.
</p>
<h3>What designs will help you achieve these tasks? Name at least two.</h3>
<p>I will use GeoJSON with randomly-generated coordinates to give each story a node.
    I will also implement the stack layout introduced in Studio 6, which will help
    will changing the visualization based on which "node"/story is moused over.
</p>
</p>

<h3>I used external resources.</h3>
