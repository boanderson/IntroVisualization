Visualization Descriptions:

I liked the Field of Commemoration visualization as it encapsulates a vast amount of information in a warming, respectful way. The complexity of the graph is simplified due to the innate ability for an observer to understand the beauty of a poppy diagram. The size, color, shape, bend, and length all contribute to each poppy's held information. The number of wars represented in this diagram is also astonishing, allowing us to gain a greater understanding of how severe even the least well-known wars can be. Everything about this visualization speaks in-character, and I believe that after observing this diagram I can say that I have learned much more about the crucial impact that wars have on communities.

I disliked the Average Life Expectancy by Breed table as it didn't take advantage of the creativity that can be accomplished with a dataset like this one. Although it "checks the boxes" and provides the information desired for that webpage, it could be improved in order to allow more engagement with the audience. I think by spicing it up a bit with the form of plot, it can allow the user to understand the data faster, more efficiently, and in a strong, mood-setting way.

My new design, New_Version_Life_Expectancy_Breeds.png, brings great change to the original dataset, but there are still a few lingering problems that my design causes. First, I did not ascertain that the colors used are color-friendly for anyone, regardless of color blindness. Second, the text along the horizontal axis that represents the different breeds is not the easiest text to read, so could improve on the overall coloring/font/slant of the text there. Third, the shadowing behind the horizontal and vertical axis labels could make the text "pop" a little more, the text is still slightly faded into the background.
